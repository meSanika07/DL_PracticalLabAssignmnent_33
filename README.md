# 🚀 YOLOv11 Object Detection Training

This repository contains the step-by-step process to train **YOLOv11** on a custom dataset. It includes dataset preparation, model training, inference, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Dataset
We are using the **COCO dataset** for training:  
🔗 [COCO Dataset on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/microsoft/coco/dataset/34)

---

## ✅ Task 1: Environment Setup & YOLOv11 Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries:
```bash
pip install roboflow ultralytics torch torchvision opencv-python
```

### 2️⃣ Verify YOLO Installation:
```bash
yolo --version
```

---

## ✅ Task 2: Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing

1. **Choose a Dataset**: Use **COCO, Pascal VOC, or a custom dataset**.
2. **Annotate Images**: If using a custom dataset, label objects using **Roboflow or LabelImg**.
3. **Convert Annotations**: Use **Roboflow** to export the dataset in **YOLO format**.
4. **Download the Dataset**: Use the **Roboflow API** to fetch the dataset.
5. **Split the Dataset**: Divide into **train (80%)**, **validation (10%)**, and **test (10%)**.

Expected Outcome: A well-structured dataset in **YOLO format**.

## ✅ Task 3: Training YOLOv11 Model

1. **Configure Training Parameters**: Set batch size, epochs, and learning rate.
2. **Train the YOLOv11 Model**: Run the training command.
3. **Monitor Training Progress**: Track **loss, accuracy, mAP**.
4. **Save the Trained Model Weights**.

Expected Outcome: A trained YOLOv11 model ready for inference.

## ✅ Task 4: Model Inference & Evaluation

1. **Load the trained model weights**.
2. **Run object detection on test images and videos**.
3. **Evaluate the model performance using**:
   - **Mean Average Precision (mAP@50, mAP@50-95)** – Measures model accuracy across different IoU thresholds.
   - **Precision & Recall** – Evaluates the tradeoff between false positives and false negatives.
   - **F1 Score** – Balances precision and recall for a comprehensive model assessment.
4. **Visualize results with bounding boxes**.

Expected Outcome: **Detection results with bounding boxes and performance metrics**.

---

### 📊 Model Performance Metrics:

- **mAP@50, mAP@50-95**: Higher values indicate better accuracy.
- **Precision**: Measures the percentage of correctly identified objects.
- **Recall**: Indicates how many actual objects were detected.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.
